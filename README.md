Website
The first basic single file HTML page I posted was just to see if I could actually get a custom domain hosted. It exposed me to DNS records stuff; how to configure so that the domain from registrar works here with GitHub Pages.
At first it was pure frustration but it's slowly dawning. At least I now have a website hosted, even if it's a single page of HTML code with no fancy css and no js scripts. It's a start, a place to begin to learn.
